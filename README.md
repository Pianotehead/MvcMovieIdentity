# A project which is simply a practice for the Agile-Movie-Database
## I will try to create a simple web app with information about movies and TV shows.
### The socalled Agile Movie Database is a group project.
### I would like to practice Identity, MvC, and styling with CSS, Bootstrap and so on.
### Then I will be better equipped to deal with the group project, and do my part.
